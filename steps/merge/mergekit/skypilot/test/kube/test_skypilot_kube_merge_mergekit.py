"""mergekit on kube: one merge in a pod on the local kind cluster reaches SUCCESS.

Reaching SUCCESS proves the uv install of MergeKit in a pod and the merge itself,
with the merged model on the shared /shared volume. Gated on a reachable kind
cluster (``make test-setup-kube`` brings it up). Extended suite only. Fixtures live
in the test-data/ dir mirroring this file (get_test_data_dir_for), so the pairing
holds in both test modes.
